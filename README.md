Kowope Mart is a Nigerian-based retail company with a vision to provide quality
goods,education and automobile services to its customer at affordable price and

with credit rewards that can be used within the Mall.
To achieve this the company has partnered with DSBank on co-branded credit card with
additional functionality such that customers can request for loan, pay for goods even
with zero-balance and then pay back within an agreed period of time. This innovative 
strategy has increased sales for the company.

zero risk of defaulting.
